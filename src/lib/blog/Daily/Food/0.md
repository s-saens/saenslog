# Crazy habits when coding

Everyone has their quirks.

When I'm deep in a coding session, I develop some interesting habits.

## The Rituals

- **Specific playlist**: Same songs on repeat
- **Snack rotation**: Always the same snacks in the same order
- **Coffee timing**: Every 90 minutes, like clockwork
- **Pacing**: Walking around while thinking about problems

## Why It Works

These habits create a mental state that helps me focus. It's like a trigger that tells my brain "time to code."

## The Downside

Sometimes I get so focused I forget to eat actual meals. Working on that.

What are your coding rituals?
