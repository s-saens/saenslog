# Making a project effectively

Tips and tricks for building Svelte projects efficiently.

Over time, I've learned several patterns that make Svelte development much smoother.

## Component Organization

Keep components small and focused. If a component does more than one thing, split it up.

## State Management

Use Svelte's reactive declarations ($:) wisely. They're powerful but can lead to subtle bugs if overused.

## Performance

Svelte compiles to vanilla JavaScript, so it's already fast. But there are still ways to optimize further.
