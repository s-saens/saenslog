Building a personal blog with SvelteKit and modern web technologies.

This blog is built with SvelteKit 2, featuring a clean, minimalist design and smooth page transitions.

## Tech Stack

- **SvelteKit**: Framework
- **TypeScript**: Type safety
- **IBM Plex Mono**: Typography
- **View Transitions API**: Smooth navigation

## Design Philosophy

I wanted something simple, fast, and distraction-free. The dark theme helps reduce eye strain during long reading sessions.
