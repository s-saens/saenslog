# Dynamic Programming Fundamentals

Understanding the basics of dynamic programming.

Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.

## Key Principles

1. Optimal substructure
2. Overlapping subproblems

## Common Patterns

- Fibonacci sequence
- Longest common subsequence
- Knapsack problem

The key is recognizing when a problem can be broken down into smaller, reusable pieces.
