A quick reference for common graph algorithms.

## Traversal
- BFS: Level-by-level
- DFS: Depth-first

## Shortest Path
- Dijkstra: Non-negative weights
- Bellman-Ford: Handles negative weights

## Minimum Spanning Tree
- Kruskal's algorithm
- Prim's algorithm

Each algorithm has its use case and trade-offs.
