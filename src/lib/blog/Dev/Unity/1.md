# Comprehensive Summary of DOTS

A deep dive into Unity's Data-Oriented Technology Stack.

DOTS represents a fundamental shift in how we build games in Unity, moving away from traditional object-oriented approaches to a data-oriented paradigm.

## What is DOTS?

DOTS consists of three main pillars:
- **ECS**: Entity Component System
- **C# Job System**: Multi-threaded code
- **Burst Compiler**: High-performance native code

## Performance Benefits

The combination of these technologies can lead to dramatic performance improvements, sometimes 10x or more compared to traditional Unity code.
