# Simple and Performant Data Handling

This is a sample blog post about Unity ECS and data-oriented design.

Unity's Entity Component System (ECS) provides a way to write high-performance code that scales well across multiple CPU cores.

## Key Concepts

1. **Entities**: Lightweight identifiers
2. **Components**: Pure data containers
3. **Systems**: Logic that transforms component data

## Benefits

- Better cache utilization
- Easier parallelization
- Cleaner code separation

This approach transforms the way we think about game architecture.
