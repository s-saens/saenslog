Exploring the benefits of Riverpod for Flutter state management.

After trying various state management solutions in Flutter, I've settled on Riverpod as my go-to choice.

## Advantages

- **Compile-time safety**: Catches errors before runtime
- **Testability**: Easy to mock and test
- **No BuildContext**: Access state from anywhere
- **DevTools support**: Great debugging experience

## Comparison with Provider

Riverpod is essentially Provider 2.0, fixing many of the pain points while maintaining a familiar API.

The learning curve is worth it for the improved developer experience.
