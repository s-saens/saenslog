First day exploring Tokyo's trendiest neighborhoods.

Started my Tokyo adventure in Shibuya, home to the famous scramble crossing.

## Shibuya Crossing

The iconic intersection is even more impressive in person. Hundreds of people crossing from all directions in perfect chaos.

## Harajuku

Walked down Takeshita Street - colorful, crowded, and full of unique shops. The crepes are amazing!

## Meiji Shrine

Found peace in the middle of the city. The contrast between the busy streets and the serene shrine grounds is striking.

Can't wait for tomorrow's adventures!
