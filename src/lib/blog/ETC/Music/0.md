# Coding Music Recommendations

What I listen to while programming.

Music is an essential part of my coding workflow. Here are my go-to genres and artists.

## Focus Music

- **Lo-fi Hip Hop**: Classic choice for concentration
- **Ambient**: When I need deep focus
- **Post-Rock**: Instrumental and emotional

## Artists

- Nujabes (RIP)
- Explosions in the Sky
- Tycho
- Boards of Canada

## Playlists

I rotate between a few carefully curated playlists depending on the task:
- Deep Work: Ambient and minimal
- Feature Development: Lo-fi and upbeat
- Debugging: Calm and patient music

## No Music Days

Sometimes silence is the best option. Learning when to unplug is important too.

What's on your coding playlist?
